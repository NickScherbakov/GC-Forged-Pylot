# ðŸš€ GC-Forged-Pylot

> An autonomous 24/7 coding system built on the foundation of llama.cpp by Georgiy Gerganov and enhanced with GitHub Copilot capabilities.

## Vision

GC-Forged-Pylot aims to create a continuous development environment where AI can work around the clock, ensuring that code continues to evolve even when human developers need to rest. By combining the efficient local inference of llama.cpp with advanced coding capabilities, we're building the future of autonomous development.

## Core Components

- **GC-Core**: Optimized llama.cpp server with enhancements for IDE integration
- **Forged-Bridge**: Advanced proxy layer for seamless integration with VSCode extensions
- **Pylot-Agent**: Autonomous agent capable of long-running programming tasks

## Getting Started

```bash
