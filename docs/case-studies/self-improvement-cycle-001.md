# Case Study: Autonomous Refactor Cycle 001

## Scenario Overview

- **Task**: "Refactor the configuration loader for clarity and add missing validation"
- **Environment**: Workstation (AMD Ryzen 7, 32 GB RAM)
- **Model**: 13B GPTQ converted to GGUF (q5_K_M)
- **Confidence Target**: 0.92
- **Cycles Executed**: 3

## Cycle Timeline

| Cycle | Planner Summary | Key Actions | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Baseline analysis of existing loader | Generated plan, ran static checks, highlighted validation gaps | 0.46 |
| 2 | Proposed modular restructure | Created draft validator, added schema hints, unit test stubs | 0.78 |
| 3 | Finalized validation layer | Integrated schema enforcement, updated docs, all tests green | **0.94** |

## Artifacts

- **Plan JSON**: `docs/case-studies/artifacts/001-plan.json`
- **Diff Patch**: `docs/case-studies/artifacts/001-diff.patch`
- **Metrics**: `docs/case-studies/artifacts/001-metrics.json`
- **Schema**: `docs/case-studies/gallery.schema.json` (validate your submissions with this)

## Highlights

- Planner split work into validation, refactor, documentation tracks allowing parallel reasoning.
- Executor detected missing configuration keys and synthesized reusable helpers instead of ad-hoc checks.
- Reviewer prompts ensured every change linked back to reported gaps; final cycle triggered targeted tests only.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Telemetry Matters** – Confidence jumped once metrics for validation coverage were logged; add observability hooks early.
2. **Reusable Prompts** – Capturing the exact planner/reviewer prompts made replay effortless for another contributor.
3. **Diff Packaging** – Storing unified diffs alongside context snapshots keeps human review lightweight.

## Replay Instructions

```bash
# 1. Load the gallery artifact and execute the plan
python run_autonomous.py "@docs/case-studies/artifacts/001-plan.json"

# 2. Apply the diff (dry run) to inspect changes
patch -p1 --dry-run < docs/case-studies/artifacts/001-diff.patch

# 3. Run the associated tests
pytest tests/core/test_config_loader.py
```
