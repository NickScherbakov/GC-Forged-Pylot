# Case Study Artifacts

This directory stores reusable data generated from autonomous improvement cycles.

## Naming Conventions

 - `media/` â€“ Optional assets (screen recordings, reports, logs) referenced by the case study.

Validate new submissions against `../gallery.schema.json` to keep the gallery consistent.

## Validation Helper

Run the helper script before opening a PR:

```bash
python bin/validate_gallery.py
```

> Example references are provided by `self-improvement-cycle-001.md`. Replace placeholder files with actual artifacts when you run the cycle.
