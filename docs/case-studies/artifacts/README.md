# Case Study Artifacts

This directory stores reusable data generated from autonomous improvement cycles.

## Naming Conventions

- `<id>-plan.json` – Planner output with structured steps, prompts, and metadata.
- `<id>-diff.patch` – Unified diff capturing code modifications.
- `<id>-metrics.json` – Confidence scores, timing info, and task-specific KPIs.

> Example references are provided by `self-improvement-cycle-001.md`. Replace placeholder files with actual artifacts when you run the cycle.
