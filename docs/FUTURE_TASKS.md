# Future Development Tasks for GC-Forged-Pylot

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for the development of GC-Forged-Pylot, particularly focusing on the autonomous self-improvement system. These tasks should be prioritized when continuing work on the project.

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Implement Feedback Handler

The `FeedbackHandler` class is referenced in our implementation but needs to be fully developed:

```python
# Path: src/bridge/feedback_handler.py
# Implementation should include:
# - Multiple notification channels (email, Telegram, etc.)
# - Feedback collection from these channels
# - Parsing and structuring received feedback
```

### 2. Create Default Configuration Files

Generate standard configuration templates:

```json
// config/self_improvement_config.json
{
  "confidence_threshold": 0.85,
  "max_default_cycles": 3,
  "feedback_poll_interval": 3600,
  "notification_channels": ["log"]
}
```

### 3. Develop Integration Tests

Create comprehensive tests for the self-improvement cycle:

```python
# tests/test_self_improvement.py
# Should cover:
# - Task analysis
# - Module generation
# - Confidence scoring
# - Feedback processing
# - Complete improvement cycles
```

### 4. Enhance Hardware Optimizer Integration

Make the hardware optimizer work seamlessly with self-improvement:

- Detect when performance bottlenecks are affecting task execution
- Adjust hardware parameters dynamically during long-running tasks
- Save optimization history alongside improvement history

### 5. Add Error Handling and Recovery

Improve system resilience:

- Graceful recovery from failed improvement cycles
- Persistent state saving for long-running operations
- Emergency notifications for critical failures

### 6. Create User Interface for Feedback

Develop a simple web interface or CLI tool for:

- Reviewing task results
- Providing structured feedback
- Monitoring improvement progress

### 7. Documentation Expansion

Add more detailed documentation:

- Architecture diagrams
- Complete API reference
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Specifics

### FeedbackHandler Implementation

The `FeedbackHandler` class should support:

```python
class FeedbackHandler:
    def __init__(self, notification_config):
        """Initialize with configuration for various channels"""
        self.config = notification_config
        self._init_channels()
    
    def send_notification(self, message, channel, metadata=None):
        """Send notification through specified channel"""
        # Implementation for each channel type
    
    def get_pending_feedback(self):
        """Check channels for new feedback"""
        # Implementation to poll channels
    
    def _init_channels(self):
        """Set up notification channels from config"""
        # Implementation details
```

### Testing Methodology

Tests should verify:

1. Task Analysis accuracy
2. Code generation quality
3. Integration with existing system
4. Confidence scoring correlation with actual result quality
5. End-to-end improvement cycles

### Additional Features to Consider

- **Version Control Integration**: Automatically commit generated modules
- **Visualization**: Create dashboards for monitoring improvement progress
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Allow multiple instances to share improvements
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Compress learned improvements into model updates

## Contribution Guidelines

When implementing these features:

1. Follow existing code style and architecture
2. Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
3. Create unit tests for new functionality
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Consider backward compatibility

## Completion Criteria

Each task should be considered complete when:

- Code implementation passes all tests
- Documentation is updated
- Pull request is reviewed and approved
- Feature works in both development and production environments
