## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some additions:

```python
# ✅ Good: Clear, documented, typed
def analyze_task(self, task_description: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Analyzes the task description to identify missing functionalities.
    
    Args:
        task_description: A brief description of the user's task
        
    Returns:
        List of missing functionalities needed
    """
    # Implementation...
    pass

# ❌ Bad: No types, no docs
def analyze(task):
    pass
```

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Type hints for all functions
- ✅ Docstrings for classes and public methods
- ✅ Comments for complex logic
- ✅ Meaningful variable names
- ✅ Black-formatted code
- ✅ Pass flake8 linting

### Testing

**Every contribution needs tests!**

```python
# tests/test_your_feature.py
import pytest
from src.your_module import YourClass

def test_basic_functionality():
    """Test the happy path"""
    obj = YourClass()
    result = obj.do_something("input")
    assert result == expected_output

def test_edge_cases():
    """Test edge cases and error handling"""
    obj = YourClass()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        obj.do_something(None)

def test_integration():
    """Test integration with other components"""
    # Integration test...
    pass
```

**Test Requirements**:
- ✅ Unit tests for new functions
- ✅ Integration tests for features
- ✅ Test edge cases and errors
- ✅ Maintain >80% code coverage
- ✅ All tests must pass

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview
Brief description of what it does

## Usage
```python
# Example code
```

## Parameters
- `param1` (type): Description
- `param2` (type): Description

## Returns
Description of return value

## Examples
More detailed examples

## Notes
Any important considerations
```

**Documentation Requirements**:
- ✅ Update README.md if adding major features
- ✅ Update relevant .md files in /docs
- ✅ Add inline code comments
- ✅ Include usage examples
- ✅ Document breaking changes

### Commit Messages
