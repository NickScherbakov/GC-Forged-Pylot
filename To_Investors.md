# To Potential Investors and Contributors: GC-Forged-Pylot Enhancement

## GC-Forged-Pylot: Your Local AI Coding Partner — Now More Powerful, Smarter, and More Convenient!

Imagine an AI programming assistant that runs **entirely on your computer**, ensuring **absolute confidentiality** of your code. That's GC-Forged-Pylot. And now, it's getting even better!

Following our planned enhancement phase (detailed in `reports/techspecs/technical_specification_en.md`), GC-Forged-Pylot will gain significant improvements, making it an indispensable tool for developers, teams, and companies prioritizing security and efficiency:

1.  **Full llama.cpp Integration:** Harness the power of cutting-edge language models locally. No clouds, no external servers (unless you choose them) – your code remains yours.
2.  **Connection Flexibility:** Need scalability or want to use an existing llama.cpp API server? The new version will allow easy connection to external servers, giving you options.
3.  **Seamless VS Code Integration:** Get intelligent suggestions, code completion, and refactoring directly within your favorite editor. Work faster and more productively in your familiar environment.
4.  **Advanced Code Tools:** New tools for parsing, refactoring, semantic search, test generation, and documentation will elevate your code quality and speed up development.
5.  **Performance Optimization:** Through caching, model quantization, and hardware-specific optimizations (including GPU support), GC-Forged-Pylot will run swiftly even on standard machines (targeting 16GB RAM for models up to 7B parameters).
6.  **Enhanced Memory & Context:** The system will remember more about your project, providing more relevant and accurate suggestions thanks to vector search and long-term memory.
7.  **Convenient Management:** A new configuration manager and web interface will allow easy setup, model management, and system monitoring.

## Development Priorities

To deliver value quickly and build a solid foundation, we are prioritizing the following initial development steps:

1.  **Core llama.cpp Integration:** Implementing the fundamental local processing capabilities.
2.  **External API Support:** Providing flexibility for different user setups and hardware.
3.  **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring the tool is responsive and usable on target hardware through caching and quantization.

These steps establish the core promise of local, efficient AI assistance. Subsequent phases will focus on VS Code integration, advanced code tools, and other enhancements outlined in the technical specification.

## Commitment to User Feedback

While our technical specification provides a clear roadmap, we understand that real-world usage is the ultimate test. We are committed to:

*   **Establishing clear feedback channels** (e.g., GitHub Issues, community forums).
*   **Actively incorporating user feedback** into our development planning, potentially adjusting priorities based on user needs and pain points.
*   **Balancing user requests** with the project's core vision of privacy, performance, and local execution.

Your input and investment can directly shape GC-Forged-Pylot into the best possible local AI coding assistant.
