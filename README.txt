GC-FORGED PYLOT
===============

An autonomous agent architecture designed for advanced reasoning, planning, and execution.

OVERVIEW
--------
GC-Forged Pylot is an experimental autonomous agent framework that integrates natural language processing, planning, reasoning, and execution capabilities. The system is designed to operate in complex environments, making decisions and performing actions based on user input, learned patterns, and programmed directives.

ARCHITECTURE
-----------
The Pylot system consists of three main components:

1. Core System
   - Planner: Creates and manages execution plans
   - Reasoner: Analyzes information and makes inferences
   - Executor: Carries out actions and commands
   - Memory: Stores and retrieves relevant information
   - LLM Interface: Connects to language models for processing

2. Bridge System
   - API Connector: Interfaces with external systems and services
   - Tool Manager: Manages available tools and capabilities
   - Feedback Handler: Processes and learns from feedback

3. Pylot Agent
   - Integrates core and bridge components
   - Manages user interactions
   - Coordinates system activities

INSTALLATION
-----------
Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies specified in requirements.txt

Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gc-forged-pylot.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the agent by modifying config/agent_config.json

USAGE
-----
Basic usage:

1. Start the agent in interactive mode:
   python src/pylot-agent/agent.py --interactive

2. Start with a custom configuration:
   python src/pylot-agent/agent.py --config path/to/config.json

3. Import and use in your code:
