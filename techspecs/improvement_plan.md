# Improvement Plan for GC-Forged-Pylot

## 1. Documentation Enhancements
- Add step-by-step guides for installation and configuration.
- Provide usage examples for beginners and advanced users.
- Create a dedicated section for the architecture overview with diagrams.

## 2. Core Features Development
- Finalize the implementation of the `LlamaLLM` class for seamless integration with llama.cpp.
- Extend `planner.py`, `reasoning.py`, and `executor.py` to support long-term task management.

## 3. Embeddings and Fine-Tuning Subsystem
- Implement the subsystem as detailed in [Issue #4](https://github.com/NickScherbakov/GC-Forged-Pylot/issues/4).
- Ensure the `.gguf` format compatibility for embeddings and model updates.

## 4. Integration and Testing
- Integrate tools like `CodeParser` and `SemanticSearch` with the agent's workflow.
- Add automated testing for new and existing modules.

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Enhance memory management for long-term context preservation.
- Optimize interaction with Llama.cpp for reduced latency and improved throughput.

## 6. Roadmap Update
- Regularly review and update the roadmap to reflect progress and new priorities.
