# Technical Specification: "embeddings&finetunings" Subsystem

## Objective
The goal is to develop a subsystem within the GC-Forged-Pylot project that manages embeddings and fine-tuning processes. This subsystem will integrate with `llama.cpp` to enable real-time updates and adjustments to the model based on interaction data.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Data Collection and Storage
- Implement a mechanism to record and store key interaction data.
- Ensure the data is structured in a format suitable for fine-tuning (e.g., JSON or `.gguf`).

### 2. Embeddings Management
- Create functionality for generating and updating embeddings from interaction data.
- Ensure compatibility with the `.gguf` format used by `llama.cpp`.

### 3. Fine-Tuning Automation
- Develop a script for automating the fine-tuning process.
- Support local fine-tuning workflows as well as remote fine-tuning through the `llama.cpp` API server.
- Output the fine-tuned model in the `.gguf` format.

### 4. API Integration
- Extend the `llama.cpp` API server to accept new interaction data and trigger fine-tuning operations.
- Provide endpoints for retrieving the updated model and embeddings.

---

## Deliverables
1. **Subsystem Implementation**:
   - A fully operational embeddings and fine-tuning subsystem integrated into the GC-Forged-Pylot project.
   - Scripts and tools required for data handling, embeddings generation, and fine-tuning.

2. **Updated Model**:
   - An updated `llama.cpp` model in the `.gguf` format, reflecting the latest fine-tuning operations.

3. **API Functionality**:
   - API endpoints for interaction data submission, fine-tuning triggers, and model retrieval.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive documentation for developers, detailing:
     - How to use the embeddings and fine-tuning subsystem.
     - The data structure requirements for fine-tuning.
     - Instructions for setting up and running the `llama.cpp` API server.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Define the formats and interfaces required for data handling and API integration.
- Investigate the `.gguf` format's capabilities for embeddings and fine-tuning.

### Phase 2: Embeddings Subsystem Implementation
- Build modules for generating and managing embeddings.
- Test with real-world interaction data.

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning Automation
- Create scripts for automating the fine-tuning process with `llama.cpp`.
- Ensure seamless integration with the embeddings subsystem.

### Phase 4: API Integration
- Add endpoints to the `llama.cpp` API server for:
  - Submitting data for fine-tuning.
  - Triggering fine-tuning operations.
  - Retrieving updated models and embeddings.
- Test API functionality with sample data.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization
- Write a detailed README for developers.
- Include examples and best practices for using the subsystem.

---

## Notes
- The subsystem must adhere to the coding standards and structure of the GC-Forged-Pylot project.
- Focus on robustness, performance, and compatibility with `llama.cpp`.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Expected Outcome
The embeddings and fine-tuning subsystem will enhance the GC-Forged-Pylot project by enabling dynamic updates to the `llama.cpp` model. This will improve the system's adaptability and performance in real-world applications.
