# Development Journal - GC-Forged-Pylot Project

## Project Overview

### Vision
GC-Forged-Pylot aims to create an autonomous 24/7 coding system with optimal hardware utilization for running Large Language Models locally. The project focuses on democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities by providing sophisticated hardware optimization that allows LLMs to run efficiently across diverse computing environments, from resource-constrained laptops to high-end servers.

### Mission
To develop a system that automatically analyzes hardware capabilities and optimizes both compilation and runtime parameters of llama.cpp, enabling efficient local LLM operation while maintaining OpenAI-compatible API for seamless integration with existing tools and workflows.

### Core Objectives
1. **Hardware Analysis & Optimization**: Automatically detect detailed hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, GPU) and optimize LLM parameters accordingly
2. **Compilation Optimization**: Generate hardware-specific builds of llama.cpp with optimal compilation flags for maximum performance
3. **Runtime Parameter Tuning**: Determine optimal thread count, batch size, context window, and GPU layer allocation
4. **Benchmarking System**: Implement comprehensive performance testing to find optimal configurations
5. **Hybrid Execution**: Balance between local computation and external API calls based on available resources
6. **Profile Persistence**: Save optimized hardware profiles for subsequent launches with adaptive updating

### Technical Approach
- **Advanced Hardware Profiling**: Detect CPU features (cores, threads, AVX/AVX2/AVX512 support), GPU capabilities (CUDA, ROCm, VRAM), and memory constraints
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Support for Windows, Linux and macOS with hardware-specific optimizations
- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Adapt thread count, context size, and batch parameters based on hardware capabilities
- **Thermal Management**: Monitor and optimize for thermal performance (planned)
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure tokens/second throughput and latency across different configurations
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design for adding new optimization strategies

### Project Goals for 2025
- Complete hardware optimization system for all major platforms
- Multi-GPU and distributed inference support
